Assumptions & Explanations:

Custom Toast in correlation with a parse string exception is used for incorrectly entered date string when editing dates. 
Comments have been limited to 100 chars using android:maxLength="100".
A clear all history function has been implemented.
Comment boxes grow in size instead of running along the same line when the characters exceed the page width.
